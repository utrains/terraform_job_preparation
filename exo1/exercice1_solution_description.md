To move the company's on-premises web server to the cloud and create a prototype infrastructure using Terraform, here’s a structured approach. I'll break it down into components related to Terraform setup, variable management, and infrastructure planning.
**Step 1: Design the Cloud Infrastructure Prototype**

Since this project involves migrating a web server to the cloud, we’ll focus on a cloud architecture in a popular provider, such as AWS or Azure. Here’s a recommended architecture plan:

    Virtual Network: Create a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) for network isolation.
    Subnets:
        Public Subnet: To host the web server and allow external access.
        Private Subnet: For database or future internal services if required.
    Security Groups: Set up firewall rules:
        Allow HTTP/HTTPS for public access to the web server.
        Restrict SSH access to specific IP addresses for administrative purposes.
    Compute Instance:
        Deploy a VM (e.g., EC2 for AWS or VM in Azure) with appropriate configurations similar to the current on-premises server.
        Use an AMI (in AWS) or image that matches the OS of the current server (e.g., Ubuntu, Windows Server).
    Elastic IP: To assign a static IP to the server for DNS mapping.
    DNS: Set up DNS configurations for the domain to point to the new server's IP.

**Step 2: Terraform Code with Variables**

To set up this infrastructure, we’ll use Terraform. Let’s create and manage variables efficiently, explore different methods of passing variables to Terraform, and develop a structured Terraform code.
1. Define Input Variables: In Terraform, we’ll create variables to parameterize the infrastructure.
